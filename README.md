Welcome to the INCLOUD-VI Java API

## WHAT IS INCLOUD-VI JAVA API?
It is a fork of the VI Java API which is a set of Java libraries that aim to ease the usage of VI 
SDK Web Services interfaces. It's now open-sourced under a mixed BSD license and Apache-2.0 license.

It provides the following benefits to the Java developers:
* Enables OO programming with a well defined managed object model
* Reduces the need to use ManagedObjectReference and makes possible 
  compile time type checking
* Hides the complexity of the PropertyCollector
* Provides necessary utility classes to simplify VI SDK web interfaces
* High performance with 4+ times faster than AXIS engine
* Adds maven support for the build system

As a result, the application code using this API is much shorter (70% less) 
and much more readable than the equivalent using web service interfaces 
directly. The API itself is straight-forward and easy to learn and use. 

## WHO CREATED THE API?
To find out more about the original VI Java API see http://vijava.sf.net

As for who created this fork called INCLOUD-VI Java that is Inspur.


## Whats with the name?

The name INCLOUD-VI means simply Yet Another VI Java. We forked this project and moved it to 
github because the project seemd stale and we felt it needed new life.


## Do I have to change my code to use this?

No!! This is a drop in replacement and requires no code modification.


## What happened to the samples?!?!

Never fear. We removed them from the core of the project and made them their own project.
